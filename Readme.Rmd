First of all you need to have the .zip file of the dataset unzipped and placed in the working directory. Then:

1 Knit the run_analysis.Rmd file which will produce two files:                            
                 run_analysis.md, which has all the code and explains it              
                 tidydata.txt, text file which contains the tidy dataset                           
                    
2 Knit the codebook.Rmd file which produces the codebook.md file   

The codebook contains the names of variables in the tidy dataset and their description. The details of how they were generated and the explanations of code lines are all within run_analysis.Rmd and run_analysis.md files.
